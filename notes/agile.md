# AGILE

[Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

Not framework or methodology, but mindset. Focuses on delivering _value_ frequently.

## Waterfall

Traditional development spends most time planning, analyzing, and designing to produce lots of documents. Then build and test.
* Need to know upfront exact product specs, guessing what customer wants.
* Business only involved in requirement specs and testing phases, not during development.
* Very easy to misinterpret requirements. Final product not what business had in mind.

## Vs Traditional

Often customer does not know what they want, until they try product, even with limited features. Idea is to collaborate with business and customer more frequently to build product incrementally.

Not _efficient_, but _effective_. Each iteration zigzags, not taking shortest straightline path to goal. In practice, since customer doesn't know what they want, shortest path unknown anyway. Focuses on _global_ rather than _local_ optimization.

## 4 Statements of Value

1. **Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and Tools
2. **Working Software** over Comprehensive Documentation
3. **Customer Collaboration** over Contract Negotiation
4. **Responding to Change** over Following a Plan

## 12 Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
